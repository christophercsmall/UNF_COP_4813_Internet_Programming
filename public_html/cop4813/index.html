                <p>
                    Static web pages created using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) remain an essential part of web design.
                    This first internet programming assignment addresses fundamental concepts and practices of web development and design while focusing the importance of structure
                    and standards used in development. In order to understand how static web pages are created and designed, this assignment requires the student learn how to read and write
                    HTML and CSS code, link external CSS files to HTML files, and basic Linux commands to create, read, and manipulate files from the terminal. Also important, is how to create folder structures
                    that keep a web site's HTML and CSS files organized.

                <p>
                    This assignment helped me learn about how much can be accomplished without the use of GUIs (Graphical User Interface). I have not used linux terminal commands
                    in a long time, so now I have a greater understanding now of the value of commonly used commands in the CLI (Command Line Interface) and the difference between and proper use of relative and
                    absolute paths when linking web pages and navigating the linux CLI. While absolute paths can always be used to link pages within the same site, it is bad practice because a domain name
                    change would require all absolute paths be changed in the entire project.

                    This assignment focuses on forms and form submission. Managing and handling events, such as clicking buttons and making selections from sets of radio buttons and dropdown
					menus are essential elements of creating dynamic web pages. We are moving on from static to more dynamic content delivery and display that allows visitors to make choices
					and consume the results according to the underlying logic designed by the developer. A lot can be achieved with just html, but a practically a whole new world opens up 
					with the inclusion of JavaScript.

                    This assignment was one of the largest I have "completed" in such a short period of time. I spent a lot of time learning JavaScript as it is not something I have spent
					much time using. I can see its power and purpose more clearly now. Also, I am still amazed at how far I can go with just HTML and JavaScript. I definitly want to learn 
					more about the limits of each and push the limits of how creative I can be given only these two resources.

            <p>
                This purpose of this assignment is to deepen our knowledge of JavaScript and repetative iterations through arrays of numbers. In order to do any calculations on sets 
                of numbers, the data set must be collected and parsed into an array. Then, each element must be iterated through for formatting, sorting, and calculation. This assignment 
                provides an introduction into the convenience and power of using arrays in programming with JavaScript.
                There is also a focus on the decomposition of large complex functions into smaller functions. In this assignment, the function for finding Standard Deviation, a commonly used fucntion in the realm of Statistics,
                is calculated by implementing small functions as modular pieces of the complex whole.

            <p>
                This assignment shows that, much like the modularity of complex functions, learning programming fundamentals can also be modular. In order to uderstand arrays, one must 
                understand data structures fundamentals. In order to understad that, one must understand loops and iterations. Before that, one must undestand variables and declarations. 
                Learning how to implement complex functions effiently is definitely a valuable piece of even more complex programming projects.

            <p>
                This assignment introduces HTML5 Canvas as a solution for creating styled text and animations using only HTML and JavaScript. Creating a canvas means designating an area 
				within a web page for displaying colors and shapes that appear static or dynamic depending on the drawing logic designed by the programmer. Shapes and colors are drawn and/or erased 
				in accordance with triggered events such as time intervals or mouse clicks. By drawing, clearing, and redrawing to slightly different dimensions, an appearance of animation can be achieved. 
				There is a deep emphasis on x and y coordinates used as reference points each time the canvas is updated. This assignment also extends the power and utility of JavaScript.

            <p>
                Though I enjoy programming of any sort, this assignment was the most daunting for me. Using JavaScript and HTML for animation takes a step outside of engineering and focuses primarily on 
				aesthetic. I can see how including a well made canvas has the potential to enhance an experience on the web. I have dabbled a bit in using sprite sheets to make retro-style RPGs, so I could get 
				a nice refresh on using frame rates and simulating collision bounderies.

            <p>
                This assignment introduces PHP (PHP: HyperText Preprocessor) as a way to generate HTML and logic output solely from the server as opposed to doing so on the client 
				like with JavaScript. Session variables are introduced as a way to create persistent data which is commonly used to maintain user login status across many pages as 
				the user navigates through the site. With this server-side scripting language, the user is oblivious to the processes that go on behind the scenes. This is of fundamental 
				value to authentication methods and other processes that the user should not be allowed to see or modify.

            <p>
                This was my first time ever coding with PHP. It was a bit uncomfortable at first because server-side scripting was a concept I had not had enough experience with 
				in order to find any value that could be applied to anything I had worked on in the past few years of studies in programming. I now have a better understanding of 
				why some processes absolutely need to be completed at the server before the user sees a single line of HTML rendered on their screen. I used to think I would rarely have 
				a need for PHP, but now I can see how it could have solved so many problems I used to work around and how PHP could be one of my most used tools in future projects.

                This assignment expands upon our knowledge of PHP and JavaScript while introducing MySQL as a database solution for web applications. Using PHP, queries can be issued 
				to a database in order to create tables and modify records that exist within. Using DML (Data Manipulation Language), it is possible to manipulate relations with SQL 
				keywords like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. This assignment also stresses the importance of referential integrity within a database and basic understanding of 
				how databases can be compromised when users are allowed to submit unsanitized strings of text through inputs in forms containing text boxes and various other types of input methods.
