                    This assignment focuses on forms and form submission. Managing and handling events, such as clicking buttons and making selections from sets of radio buttons and dropdown
					menus are essential elements of creating dynamic web pages. We are moving on from static to more dynamic content delivery and display that allows visitors to make choices
					and consume the results according to the underlying logic designed by the developer. A lot can be achieved with just html, but a practically a whole new world opens up 
					with the inclusion of JavaScript.

                <p>
                    This assignment was one of the largest I have "completed" in such a short period of time. I spent a lot of time learning JavaScript as it is not something I have spent
					much time using. I can see its power and purpose more clearly now. Also, I am still amazed at how far I can go with just HTML and JavaScript. I definitly want to learn 
					more about the limits of each and push the limits of how creative I can be given only these two resources.
